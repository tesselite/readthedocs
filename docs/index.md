# **welcome to tesselite**


## **overview**

This is the official documentation of Tesselite Limited and licenced products.

This documentation provides all information needed to use our products.[^1] The documentation is broken in three layers:


- **high level** documentation[^3]: what is the vision behind our products?

- **low level** documentation[^2]: what are the technical challenges in engineering of the software?

- **usage** documentation: how to set your computer to experiment our products? 


[^1]: the material exposed in the documentation is original, not published elsewhere. If you use our material always reference our website.
[^2]: our products are not production ready yet. we do not recommend to plug and use our products as such.  
[^3]: our products are served as cloud services (software as service model). But, this service model is transient in the grand plan of revolutionizing AI just another time. 


Our motto is : *"many hard-shelled problems are in fact unexplored mathematics. 
The problem is not hard. We are just ill-equipped to solve it.
Instead of cycling, to make the existing tools work. Let's equip with the right tools."*

We are building those tools. The next generation tools. Those tools might befit your problem, we never know right?
Let's take a tour.
