# **welcome to tesselite**


## **overview**

This is the official documentation of Tesselite Ltd and licenced products (@relief, @routerAI).

This documentation provides all information needed to use our products.[^1] The documentation is broken in three layers:

- **usage** documentation: how to set your computer to experiment our products. 

- **low level** documentation: what are the technical challenges in the engineering of customer facing software.[^2]

- **high level** documentation: what is the vision behind our products.[^3]




[^1]: the material exposed in the documentation is original, not published elsewhere. If you use our material always reference our website.
[^2]: our products are not production ready yet. we do not recommend to plug and use our products as such.  
[^3]: our products are served as cloud services (software as service model). But, this service model is transient in the grand plan of revolutionizing AI just another time. 

## **tesselite**

Our motto is : *"many hard-shelled problems are in fact unexplored mathematics. 
The problem is not hard. We are just ill-equipped to solve it.
Instead of cycling, to make the existing tools work. Let's equip with the right tools."*

We are building those tools. The next generation tools. Those tools might befit your problem, we never know right?
Let's take a tour.


## **products**


### *@relief (geometry detection)*

/r.I.l.i.e.f/

We are building the next generation edge detector (sharpener / filter). 
In our wording, it drills geometry out of images.
Then produces radar like images. We named it **Relief**.
