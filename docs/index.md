## **about another AI revolution..**

````python fct_label="python"
import tesselite

tesselite.about()

We are living in the first AI revolution. The first AI revolution is a expensive scientific experiment started by Google in the early 2010. 
This scientific experiment outputs fantastic algorithms like the one of chatGPT. 
Those algorithms demonstrates empirically that language or vision can be taught to a machine.
And a machine can outperform humans on those specific tasks.
In practice, those AI algorithms need a lot of money to reach sufficient accuracy on a given task. 
The first revolution has not proven yet a sustainable economic model could be drawn from investing large amount of money in AI algorithms.
The first revolution concerns mainly companies with large R&D, like big companies and heavily subsidized startups.

This large amount of money is in balance with natural intelligence labor. 
Human intelligence and labor is still by a magnitude far cheaper than training an AI 
Even though, a tuned AI outperforms human by an order of magnitude on specific task. AI is still far too expensive in comparison cheap human intelligence and labor.
On the business side is not clear how profitable will be the first revolution AI? Not speaking of the negative impact on the ecology (we did calculations right [here](content/second-ai-revolution.md))


On the scientific side, the first AI is a fantastic breakthrough. The first AI revolution demonstrates empirically that:

1. real life objects can be versed into data spaces and computed. Isn't necessary to extend mathematics to model more than numbers?
2. language can be computed. Isn't necessary to rethink language as a computer science?
3. physical objects can be understood by a computer. Isn't necessary to merge signal and cognitive sciences into a computer science?


AI first revolution will have groundbreaking and lasting impact on scientific field. All sciences will be reshuffled to adapt to the new AI frontier. This adaptation will last sometimes as current scientists are not versed into AI technologies. And AI publications are not considered as hardcore sciences as maths and physics.
To scientific community, AI are a computing techniques and statistics. What they are. AI are practical, but theoretically not well established.

Meanwhile, an active research is done to build computers adapted to AI. Regular computer are not designed to run AI computations. Ensued performance bottleneck and poor usage of resources. 
Some manufacturers already commercialize AI adapted computers.   




## **documentation overview**

````python fct_label="python"
import tesselite

tesselite.docs.list()
````

The documentation provides all information needed to use our products.[^1] The documentation is broken in three layers:


- **high level** documentation[^2]: what is the vision behind our products?

- **low level** documentation[^3]: what are engineering challenges in building our products?

- **usage** documentation: how to set your computer to experiment our products? 


[^1]: the material exposed in the documentation is original, not published elsewhere. If you use our material always reference our website.
[^2]: our products are served as cloud services (software as service). But, this service model is transient in the grand plan of revolutionizing AI just another time. 
[^3]: our products are not production ready yet. we do not recommend to plug and use our products as such.
