## Tesselite

Our motto is : *"many hard-shelled problems are in fact unexplored mathematics. 
The problem is not hard. We are just ill-equipped to solve it.
Instead of cycling, to make the existing tools work. Let's shift focus and equip with the right tools."*

We are building those tools. The next generation tools. Those tools might befit your problem, we never know right?
Let's take a tour.


## Products


### Relief

/r.I.l.i.f/

We are building the next generation edge detector / sharpener / filter. In our wording, it extracts geometry from images.
And produces radar like images. We named it **Relief**.
